# Timeify

Timeify is a ToDo program developed on the Net.Core platform. It enables prospective users to register and then create jobs and tasks. A job includes several tasks. Individual tasks can be assigned to users. These users can then complete the tasks.

The program is designed to show different concepts and does not provide a ready-to-use solution.
